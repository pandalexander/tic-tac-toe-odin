// Create IIFE Gameboard that gets current state, makes mark, and prints
// Maybe set a data key for numbering the spaces and then building the 3x3 board afterward
// make sure that the makesMark function can only operate if the Cell()'s value is 0. If it is 1 or 2, it cannot work.

// Put a function that creates an object (like the Cell() in the example) that contains a function to change it's current value to a player's token and a function is get it's current value

//  Get some function that marks a square either a 0, 1, or 2. 0 means empty, 1 is player 1, 2 is player 2. Labeling token is a good idea.

// Create player objects with player 1 having token = 1, player 2 having token = 2
